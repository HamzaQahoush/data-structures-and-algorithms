## Approach & Efficiency

we need to use apply the principle of Binary search.
so we need to look for value in the list and sure its exist between first and last index .
so we need to refers to them as left and right .
then we need to check our number if it exists in the middle of array.
for example : if the value of middle array is less than our target value .
so we confine our search on the mid of arr +1
and we repeat and , check of target value in new narrowed length etc
we will keep doing that until search range become empty that means the value does'nt exists
